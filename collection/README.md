> `homecloud` provides a ready-to-use set of resources to bootstrap a cloud at home mainly based on Kubernetes, Longhorn and Syncthing.

## Presentation

`homecloud` aims to provide a cloud like environment, especially an internal cloud, at home.
The underlying infrastructure is primarily based on low cost ARM boards, like Raspberry Pi, and powered by open source solutions like Kubernetes, Longhorn or Syncthing.

The main artifact is an Ansible collection designed to bootstrap a ready to use cloud like environment as well as a couple of end-users services.

The documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tmorin/homecloud-ansible#readme).
